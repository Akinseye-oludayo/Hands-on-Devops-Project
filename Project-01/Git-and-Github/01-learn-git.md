### WHAT IS GIT
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase over time.

#### Key Features:

**Local Version Control:** Git operates on your local machine, allowing you to track changes, create branches, and make commits without needing an internet connection.
**Branching:**  Git enables developers to work on different features or fixes in separate branches, facilitating parallel development.
**Commits:** Developers can create commits to capture and record changes to the codebase.

### WHAT IS GITHUB
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development projects using **Git** for version control.
#### Key Features:

**Remote Hosting:** GitHub allows developers to store their Git repositories on the cloud, providing a centralized location for collaboration.
**Collaboration:** GitHub offers features like issues, pull requests, and project boards to facilitate collaboration among developers.
**Visibility:** GitHub repositories are often public, allowing others to view, fork, and contribute to projects.

- Checks complete when what you have on GitHub is the same as what you have on the cloud

**Step two**
- On your local, create a branch,
- On the new branch, add commands used to create a branch and push it to the new branch
